## What is System Design?

System design is the art and science of designing and implementing large-scale systems. The goal of System Design is to put the right tools for the job and do it efficiently.

Examples of such systems are Uber, social media apps, shopping apps or websites etc.

## Who is it for?

System design is, in my view, best suited for developers with more than three years of experience, who are accustomed to building and maintaining small-scale applications in their daily work. This is because system design encompasses a range of topics, including application architecture design, data storage, scaling, caching systems and etc.

These are all components used in real-world production environments. A solid understanding of these areas can significantly boost your confidence when tackling system design topics.

## Any pre-requisites for System Design?

Thoroughly understand the architecture of your current project. Illustrate the flow of actions from one system to another using a simple block diagram of various components. After completing the diagram, delve into more details about each component and its internal parts.

## Why System Design is needed for Interviews?

In this open-ended interview, the interviewer will ask us to construct a system for a given problem with minimal input. This allows them to assess our problem-solving approach and our broader knowledge of software/data application design.

There is no perfect or correct solution because no system is flawless. Our goal is to develop a solution that is as close to perfect as possible, without leaving any significant gaps in the provided requirements.

## **Why I want to learn System Design for interviews?**

- Interviews often start with system design. I'm still learning, but revising will be easier than learning a new topic from scratch.
- You may not use a wide range of technologies/tools daily. Yet, understanding these systems to tackle scaling and other problems is crucial for experienced roles.
- If a specific issue arises at work, you might already have some knowledge about the problem. This is very important.

The system design interview books in the “Resources” section provide many solutions to potential career problems.
