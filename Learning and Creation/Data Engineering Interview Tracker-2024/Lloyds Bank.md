### First Round - Technical (verbal) round

- Duration: ~30mins
- Interviewer (Sukwinder) asked me about myself and projects. Not in-depth technical round.
- Asked me about current project, architecture, implementation details etc.
- Few questions on CI/CD in the projects and data validation, transformation

### Notes

- Interview was okay. Nothing spectacular and I felt like I was on an interview for an internal team than a new company
- Lloyds is setting up a new Tech center in Hyderabad, so they are in a hurry mode.
