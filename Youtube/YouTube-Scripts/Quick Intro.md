## **Greet and introduce yourself**

- Hello folks! Hope you're doing well. This is Mani and welcome to my channel. I'm a Data Engineer and a cloud practitioner/enthusiast. I love tech and I love talking about it
- This is a brand new video on my band new channel. Please like, share and subscribe to the channel for content on data engineering and cloud related stuff. Lets go

## **Talk about your experience**

- I started off as a Test Engineer in the IT industry, later on transitioned to an automation test engineer role. After that I worked as a python + data engineering role within the same company. This transition from an automation engineer to a dev role has been a wild ride for me and quite a rewarding oneðŸ˜‡
- The python dev role also included AWS as well and that is how I began my cloud + data engineering journey
- Currently I work as a data engineer and the data stack is primarily on Cloudera HDP.

## Why this channel? Explain the purpose.

- Primarily, I want to document my knowledge on the tech that I work on with quality videos and share it with the community. If this exercise benefits anyone in the community, then it is a win-win
- I believe that while explaining a concept both the listener and the one explaining it will understand better
- Also, the process of documenting, although very challenging; helps me to fine-tune the process of self-learning and delivery which is a huge plus
- I would also share the details on my journey a bit and on my experience in the industry

## Who is this channel for?

- This channel primarily focuses on data engineering + cloud content for beginners to start with
- Down the line, I would love to explore the tech that has good amount of demand in the industry and also things that I really like to work with.
- I might add some videos on how I ended up as a cloud data engineer but tutorial videos comes first

### Upcoming Video

- The upcoming video would be on the data engineering roadmap for beginners and professionals.
