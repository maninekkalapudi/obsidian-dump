### What is Data Engineering?

A field that deals with a storing, processing of very large amounts of data which is in different formats, shapes and sizes.

### Story Time: About a brand new company

- Suppose you're a business leader and you want to have a good view on how your business is doing like an ecommerce business
- You'll build a team of software engineers to capture the business transactions for different stakeholders like customers, internal departments and vendors through the apps/website
- Along with the SW Engineers, data professionals like DBA designs the databases to store data from various business functions. Examples for databases are Oracle, MySql, Postgres, SAP and etc.

- Explain database as a transaction system. Ex: A customer placing an order in the website/app

- As a data professional, our main focus is the data here. How is it stored? What does the business requires from the stored data? and how does the systems scale under large volumes of data?

- You also hire the SQL developers, BI engineers to get the analytics and dashboards done for the data you're capturing. This helps you get the key insights into the operations and helps make decisions both long term and on a daily basis.
- Business runs 24/7. Once the wheel is set in motion, it'll run round the clock. So, the data will be generated round the clock
- Now we have large volumes of data, the data will be flowing in continuously which generally referred as velocity of the data and finally variety of data. BTW, This is a formal definition of Big Data. To store this type of data, we use a very large data storage system like a data warehouse.
- Limitations of a database serving data to different endpoints like reporting, visualizations and etc. for a large data
- A team of software engineers and data professionals along with the business personnel will work along to move, standardize and serve the data to different stakeholders at large
- _**Advantage**_: Once the data is standardized and dumped in to the data warehouse, every department should be able to access the data according to the business requirement just like a database. This eliminates the data silos within the organization and anyone with right permissions can leverage the data without friction or administrative hurdles unlike the databases
- All of this should happen automatically and reliably without any data loss whatsoever! Hmm, sounds a but terrifying but interesting problem nevertheless
- _**A point to consider**_: Lets not get ourselves overwhelmed by the jargons. We'll breakdown everything into small parts and understand individual pieces and tie them all together in a meaningful way in the end

### Who is a data engineer?

A data engineer helps building tools, processes and platform(s) to automatically ingest, clean, transform the data at massive scale. Once the data is ingested, the data engineering team builds a platform to provide access to all the stakeholders to the unified data platform based on the business governance requirements.

Often there will be business rules on how to transform the data and convert to a format that is accepted organization-wide.

The typical stakeholders that will access the platform are

1. Business users
2. BI/Data Visualization tools
3. Machine Learning applications
4. API for external consumption

  

## The Data Engineering Skillset

"[The Data Engineering Roadmap-2021](https://techfirst.medium.com/the-2021-data-engineer-roadmap-f6b9c6ef2c5f)" is a pretty exhaustive guide to give you a overall picture of the modern data engineering landscape. So, lets dive into it!

_**A Note to Beginners/Practitioners**_:

YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEARN ALL OF THESE SKILLS TO BECOME A DATA ENGINEER! A typical data engineer would master a subset of these tools throughout several years depending on his/her company and career choices. So, lets go!

  

The goal of going through this roadmap is to carve out the essential skills to become a data engineer.

1. Git
2. Linux
3. Python
4. Database and Data warehousing fundamentals
5. SQL and MySQL/PostgreSQL
6. Important components in Hadoop ecosystem (HDFS, MapReduce, Hive, YARN)
7. Apache Spark
8. Apache Airflow
9. Cloud- AWS, Azure, GCP

  

_**In the right order:**_

1. SQL and MySQL/PostgreSQL/Oracle with Database fundamentals
2. Python (personal preference)
3. Important components in Hadoop ecosystem (HDFS, MapReduce, Hive, YARN)
4. Apache Spark
5. Git and GitHub
6. Airflow (python-based) -Scheduler
7. Linux
8. Cloud- AWS, Azure, GCP
