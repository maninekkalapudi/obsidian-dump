# Intro

As DEs, we deal with data a lot. The data comes in to the warehouse in all shapes and forms and it can be put into 3 different categories.

1. Structured - Data is arranged in a tabular format. Ex: database tables, csv and text files
2. Semi-structured - Data in the form of JSONs and XMLs. Ex: API responses and NoSQL databases
3. Unstructured data - Photos, audio and videos

  

The tabular data format is widely popular in analytics world.

We store the data in various tables in a database and connect them together with a relationship. So, the tabular data in databases is also called as “Relational” data in database.

Example: Customer and order data

We use Structured Query Language or SQL to perform operations on tabular data.
