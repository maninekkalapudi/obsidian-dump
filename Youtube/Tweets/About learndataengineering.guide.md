Hey \#data people!ðŸ‘‹ I've been meaning to talk about something I was working from almost a month.

Context:  
I've been in the \#dataengineering field for around 4 years at this point and I get asked about how to get into the field or relevant skillset.  

When I was learning cloud, I've came across a wonderful project called @learntocloud(LTC). Huge props to Gwen(@madebygps) and Rishab(@rishabk7) for putting up this awesome open-source project and learners in the right direction.

LTC teaches cloud from fundamentals and branches to devops and cloud security. Every cloud learner should check this out!

I wanted to make something like that for DE as well. An open-source GitHub project which provides a guide to learn data engineering.

website:

https://www.learndataengineering.guide

GitHub:

The website for the project wouldn't be possible without the awesome GitHub project, tw-jekyll by @vsoch. Thank you!

As mentioned earlier, this project draws a lot of inspiration from LTC on many levels. The focus is to provide a simple enough guide to begin/navigate the modern data engineering field without conplicated BS or most importantly a huge fees

Few things about the project:

You can follow me or @data_engineered for updates on the project.

You can also follow LinkedIn page for regular updates on the project:

While you're there, please follow the handles and star the GitHub repo!

  

The project is still in alpha stage meaning lot of work is still pending. If you have any ideas or feedback, please feel to shoot a message or raise a PR on any topic.
