Summary: This task is to build data dashboards for measuring activation and retention against control groups and giving cross-functional partners the ability to self-serve information about tooltip effectiveness among new user cohorts. Next steps include asking Jonny for access to Hex and scheduling a cross-functional meeting for feedback and requests. The non-goal is to track how often tooltips are skipped.
