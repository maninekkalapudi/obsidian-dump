### Projects and Tasks are built with 4 core concepts

[![](https://www.notion.so/images/app-packages/projects-and-tasks-getting-started.png)](https://www.notion.so/images/app-packages/projects-and-tasks-getting-started.png)

1. **Projects —** Each project has its own page (like this one!) where you can add tasks and project details. All of your projects are also housed in your newly created Projects page.
2. **Tasks —** All of your tasks live in the Tasks page. Like projects, tasks open as their own pages where you can add subtasks and assign them to projects.
3. **Properties —** Label projects and tasks with relevant information like status, assignee, due date, and more — all in the form of properties.
4. **Views —** Visualize your work with custom layouts and filters. Each view uses the same underlying data but displays it in new ways so that you can quickly keep track of your team’s work.
