Confession time 🙂

Lets talk about what worked and what didn’t.

**What worked:**

- Small targets and working with a process in mind works wonders. I never felt happier while working on something that I wanted to after a long time.
- Initial excitement ≠ end results. So, keep it real low
- Large projects and lengthy processes just straight up drains a lot of energy. Cut the crap and do the stuff
- My wellbeing is very important. Both physical and mental
- To-do list helps reduce stress a lot and I should do it more often
- Social media is good but only of you don’t have to think about it all the time
- Rigid planning doesn’t work on me. Nope. not today and not ever.
- Having a good enough plan is very important than having no plan. DO NOT OVERDO IT!
- Family is very important
- Timeboxing a task is 💕! I should do it all the time
- Focus is still sparse and coming out in bursts at times. Need to work on that

**What didn’t:**

- I’m still stuck on my phone for huge dopamine hit
- Keep forgetting to start the timer before the tasks 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
