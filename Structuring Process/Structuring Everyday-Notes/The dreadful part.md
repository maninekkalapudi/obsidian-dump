**Why do it now? Why not earlier? Where do I start this? If at all I’m serious about this.**

I will omit the infamous “I don’t know” dialogue. Its fine even if I’m ignorant about it or even not competent enough to pull it off. Uff! with that out of the way lets start doing.

**Most dreaded part/question**: When I think of my future and my expectations towards them, I feel happy, very pumped and I’ll be left in fascination of the results. No real work will ever flow in to my mind but there will be a lot of imagination that goes in the results that may occur in the future. This sucks because I feel like I’m in the haze and going nowhere. I can’t break this down in any meaningful way to work on it. As things pile up, I feel like a complete loser.

I did try to break things on a whim multiple times but those attempts are dead before I knew so. I believe that I didn’t have the courage to get to the part where I get to the actionable tasks. I always feared about the results and cared too much about useless details. This still goes on to this day.

**What do I want?** I want to have a the courage to face myself and be confident enough to get to the goals I set for myself and actually achieve them within the assumed time. I feel a bit weary of that sentence. Although it seems very innocent and very much doable, it’s not! Or at least I couldn’t be able to do it till now. I want to change that and need to show examples for myself that I can accomplish my goals not by accident but by choice.

**Where do I start?** I want to start with clearing of things on my plate right now. This offers peace and necessary time and energy. While doing so, I want to avoid any rabbit holes and try not to overdo anything. Everything I want to do must go on a list and needs a priority and approximate time to get it done. The list, the priority and the timeboxing a task is to ensure that I can only do that specific task(s) at a given point in time and offer me clarity on how I pan to spend my day.
