Well, I wrote about what’s in my head and created a process for myself. Hmm, How to put into the process action? The reasonable question is, How well can I follow the process over the time. It is an interesting thing, isn’t it?

My immediate answer is, I don’t. I just want out of it. I’m very much interested in shattered dreams, broken heart than accomplishing something. I care a lot about how I feel than the urge to pursue something till the end and finish meaningfully. But this is the problem of my life and a real “goldmine”.

When I see a problem that fixes “everything” I call it a potential goldmine. I feel the internet is a goldmine and I believe learning about it gives me superpowers than everyone. I do love internet so to speak and it gives a tremendous advantage.

If I struck the “potential goldmine” right, I might make a better life for myself and be proud of it. This requires focus and persistence over the period of time amidst all the failure, dissatisfaction and disappointment.

Speaking of the process, I need a sustainable, long-term framework of kind which is close to who I am and a good room for improvement. I don’t want to just tick some to-dos and give myself the false impression that I’m doing good. I want the ultimate version of process execution that is stuck in my head ever since.

_**What process is stuck in my head?**_

- Wake up early in the morning. Read to my kid
- Perform meditation and some exercises
- Household work and spend some time with the family for breakfast
- Later get some work done for an hour or so for blogging, making videos and other fun stuff
- Spend sometime on social media or read a book
- Start work and plan the rest of the day
- Spend some time with the family in the evening
- Have dinner and sleep

Simple, eh?
