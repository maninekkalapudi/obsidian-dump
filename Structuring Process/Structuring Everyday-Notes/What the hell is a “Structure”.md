I wake up a little exhausted and I am a bit worried almost every day. At least this was the case back in the day. My biggest worry was “What the hell should I do with my day?”. That thought quickly struck the fear area of my brain and I would panic start my day like cold-starting a car on a winter day.

Fear drove me crazy and I never liked it one bit. I always wished that I was the master of my life. I took sweet amount of time on soul searching and got to some interesting conclusions. I want to document them here going further.

Thinking a bit about my fears and so called “laziness”, **I do realize that most of that is made up in my head and as pretty much meaningless**. With that out of the way, I confess that **I had no way of doing any task and always jumped right into them without any clarity whatsoever** which ended up resulting in failure, frustration and anxiety most of the time.

I was under the impression that I will only win when I do my best in the things I love. Although the truth of this statement is highly debatable and it nearly killed my spirit. What the hell does it mean when some say “things I love”? or worse “I’m passionate about X”. I was completely sold to these ideas earlier and it was such a waste of time.

While this internal debate was happening in my head, I witnessed something else happening as well. I was not able to do anything. I was stuck with fear on one end and “I’m unable to do anything I love” paranoia on the other. This should’ve been my wake up call but it wasn’t. I did try few things, like teaching myself some tech skills, that helped my career and life but I always felt that I lacked proper structure and failed miserably.

At this point, I started feeling that I might be addicted and obsessed to referring to my own failures and bringing myself down. Too much negativity in my head. This has to stop now. Well, there was no easy way out of this so to speak. The desperation of getting out of that created more problems and thanks to my fascination towards instant gratification... it’s only downhill from there.

Things have changed in my life and in my career for good. I’m married now and I’ll have a kid soon. It is both a happy and a bit scary situation at the same time. I’ll stick with the happy part mostly. Also, I’m planning on creating a brand for myself through YouTube, Twitter and write some blog posts on my blog. All of this cannot happen while I stay the same. I want to make all of this happen sustainably while having a healthy family life.

What are the things I’m focusing on?

1. **Family**
2. **Learning new tech and write blog posts on them**
3. **YouTube - Sharing my journey as a Developer**
4. **Sharing my knowledge, insights and shitposting on Twitter**
5. Obligatory sharing on LinkedIn
6. Freelancing

All of this seems like a lofty goal and kicks my imposters syndrome right in the balls. It is a lot honestly and I need to find a way and not suck at implementing, sticking to it to the end. What do I do? How to pull this thing off?

It is a lot hazier that I thought. I spend most of the day fascinating with the thought about the results I could have achieved by doing YouTube, Twitter without taking any effort required in to the picture. We all know how this would end up.

Between the expectations and the reality, I fuck around a lot and it shows. Its not a bad thing to have expectations unless they are way off the reality that I live in. Which is, in my case true. I want to close the gap eventually. First and foremost would be to close the gap that I dread between my what I want vs what I can.

This is where the “structure” comes to play. Structure is way to contain all the chaos and hopefully get benefit from it. Importantly, it answers the age old question “What should I do today?”.

What do I think of it? Is this the be-all-end-all solution that I’m looking for over the years? NO! I don’t think it is and I believe if it hardly makes any difference to start with. What I hope it does is that the structure helps me to improve my lows and help me function without mental breakdowns or panic attacks. I’m trying to avoid the too many things pulling me in different directions at once.

This is what I want. A functional, less dramatic, boring and routine life. There you go. I said that I was pondering on it for so long. I want to be boring (doing the same thing again and again with slight improvements) and be efficient in what I pick and do on a day to day basis.
