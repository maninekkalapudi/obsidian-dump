> The reality always differs from the reality in your head

  

The primary reason to introduce any sort of structure is to eliminate the uncertainty and introduce a predictable behavior to some extent. I will move along the same lines. A routines is designed to reduce the amount of uncertainty. Without it I’ll be hunting for something good and end up seeking dopamine hits for social media. My social media “addiction” is primarily because of this boredom.

The another thing routine offers is closure. A mental checkbox that says “I’ve completed it within this time” and it makes me feel I was in charge of myself and also being productive. The mental checkbox that says “I’ve done it” is a tiny reward that completes habit loop. This is great.

I want to tap into my habit formation and establish the routine. I believe that I’m a habitual person and once I like something, I cannot stop myself from doing it. It is a blessing in disguise but I will focus on the blessing part.

Timeboxing a task is a powerful technique. I was scared to do it initially by hinting lot of stupid reasons. My biggest fear was “What if I miss something that was really good?”. I wanted to stay on top of all the things, which is really stupid and exhausting. As I experimented with timeboxing, I understood that it helps me achieve clarity tremendously and get the task done without any anxiety.

Timelines helps with figuring out on what should I do for the month, year and so on. This entirely on based on theme that I want to follow that year. For example, reading more books this year, writing blog posts and producing content. All of these are to avoid any uncertainty and provide a solid foundation/structure.

Whenever I think or write about something like this, my brain goes brrr... constantly pulling me down with the weight of all the negative things that it could think of. Naturally, I just send some positive thoughts to reinforce my intentions and few weeks later, I’m back where I started.

That hurts! I avoid the negative thoughts, fight with them and create a lot of mess, tried accepting them and to my misfortune I couldn’t get past them. Now I sort of don’t care about it because I understood that my goals are much bigger and brighter than the negativity.

_**Key takeaway**_:

1. I need a _**task list for the day, week**_ is much better.
2. A _**theme for the upcoming months or year**_ is awesome. Helps with gaining clarity, reducing stress and get productive.
3. This is not a silver bullet or silver lining to all the things I wanted. So, try not to overdo it, plan exhaustively.
4. You are doing this to be less anxious about life and live it fully. Being productive doesn’t make you happy but it offers you free time and lets you explore the creative side.
5. You will find failure in every corner and in every way you try. That’s the way it is. You got to enjoy the art of finding something you really like despite of the failures.
6. Enjoy your time with family, work and building things you like!

  

Good luck, Mani!
