## Highlights
Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.13 — location: [259](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=259) ^ref-655

---
when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It’s the accumulation of many missteps—a 1 percent decline here and there—that eventually leads to a problem. — location: [270](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=270) ^ref-29675

---
Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations. — location: [279](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=279) ^ref-63019

---
it doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. — location: [280](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=280) ^ref-48613

---
You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results. — location: [281](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=281) ^ref-54913

---
You get what you repeat. — location: [286](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=286) ^ref-39909

---
Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. — location: [290](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=290) ^ref-29761

---
Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. — location: [320](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=320) ^ref-15469

---
the most powerful outcomes are delayed. — location: [327](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=327) ^ref-16595

---
The outside world only sees the most dramatic event rather than all that preceded it. — location: [336](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=336) ^ref-14980

---
Mastery requires patience. — location: [340](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=340) ^ref-44342

---
The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us. And the task of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at a time. — location: [356](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=356) ^ref-56159

---
if successful and unsuccessful people share the same goals, then the goal cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers. — location: [386](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=386) ^ref-34615

---
Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That’s the counterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. — location: [395](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=395) ^ref-35128

---
What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results. — location: [397](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=397) ^ref-28750

---
The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal, then I’ll be happy.” — location: [400](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=400) ^ref-31228

---
The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone. — location: [401](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=401) ^ref-52583

---
goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. — location: [404](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=404) ^ref-27667

---
You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. — location: [420](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=420) ^ref-43703

---
Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe. — location: [461](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=461) ^ref-1598

---
The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. — location: [499](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=499) ^ref-41688

---
Once your pride gets involved, you’ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits. — location: [502](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=502) ^ref-22401

---
True behavior change is identity change. — location: [503](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=503) ^ref-36606

---
Progress requires unlearning. — location: [537](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=537) ^ref-22673

---
your habits are how you embody your identity. — location: [544](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=544) ^ref-47109

---
Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.” — location: [549](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=549) ^ref-8640

---
Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. — location: [566](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=566) ^ref-47446

---
The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do. — location: [570](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=570) ^ref-54084

---
Each habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far more important: to trust yourself. — location: [576](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=576) ^ref-26729

---
If nothing changes, nothing is going to change. — location: [583](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=583) ^ref-4890

---
Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits. — location: [602](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=602) ^ref-25730

---
The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not getting a particular outcome. — location: [604](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=604) ^ref-8571

---
“Are you becoming the type of person you want to become?” — location: [608](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=608) ^ref-44353

---
You can choose the identity you want to reinforce today with the habits you choose today. — location: [611](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=611) ^ref-53049

---
Conversely, when you have your habits dialed in and the basics of life are handled and done, your mind is free to focus on new challenges and master the next set of problems. Building habits in the present allows you to do more of what you want in the future. — location: [688](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=688) ^ref-57591

---
Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state. — location: [706](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=706) ^ref-33380

---
It sounds simple, but a habit can occur only if you are capable of doing it. — location: [714](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=714) ^ref-20747

---
The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. — location: [716](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=716) ^ref-57812

---
Your brain is a reward detector. — location: [722](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=722) ^ref-61136

---
Every goal is doomed to fail if it goes against the grain of human nature. — location: [780](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=780) ^ref-48057

---
“Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” — location: [845](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=845) ^ref-9300

---
Pointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level. — location: [859](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=859) ^ref-52818

---
The more automatic a behavior becomes, the less likely we are to consciously think about it. — location: [863](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=863) ^ref-29935

---
Many of our failures in performance are largely attributable to a lack of self-awareness. — location: [866](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=866) ^ref-45074

---
“Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?” Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad. — location: [904](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=904) ^ref-46006

---
The goal is to simply notice what is actually going on. Observe your thoughts and actions without judgment or internal criticism. Don’t blame yourself for your faults. Don’t praise yourself for your successes. — location: [907](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=907) ^ref-58341

---
The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this sentence: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. — location: [967](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=967) ^ref-52458

---
When your dreams are vague, it’s easy to rationalize little exceptions all day long and never get around to the specific things you need to do to succeed. — location: [979](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=979) ^ref-4411

It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often. — location: [1278](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1278) ^ref-52453

Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the feelings they try to numb. — location: [1291](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1291) ^ref-49730

We need to make our habits attractive because it is the expectation of a rewarding experience that motivates us to act in the first place. — location: [1467](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1467) ^ref-27597

---
You’re more likely to find a behavior attractive if you get to do one of your favorite things at the same time. — location: [1489](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1489) ^ref-8752
