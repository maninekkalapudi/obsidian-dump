## Highlights
Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better. — location: [436](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009K6DKTS&location=436) ^ref-62221

The antifragile loves randomness and uncertainty, which also means—crucially—a love of errors, a certain class of errors. Antifragility has a singular property of allowing us to deal with the unknown, to do things without understanding them—and do them well. Let me be more aggressive: we are largely better at doing than we are at thinking, thanks to antifragility. I’d rather be dumb and antifragile than extremely smart and fragile, any time. — location: [441](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009K6DKTS&location=441) ^ref-1491

---
anything that has more upside than downside from random events (or certain shocks) is antifragile; the reverse is fragile. — location: [459](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009K6DKTS&location=459) ^ref-41260

---
This is the tragedy of modernity: as with neurotically overprotective parents, those trying to help are often hurting us the most. — location: [467](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009K6DKTS&location=467) ^ref-32495

It is said that the best horses lose when they compete with slower ones, and win against better rivals. — location: [970](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009K6DKTS&location=970) ^ref-55269

---
the irony of the process of thought control: the more energy you put into trying to control your ideas and what you think about, the more your ideas end up controlling you. — location: [1084](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009K6DKTS&location=1084) ^ref-42689

Much of modern life is preventable chronic stress injury. — location: [1338](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009K6DKTS&location=1338) ^ref-49801

---
the random element in trial and error is not quite random, if it is carried out rationally, using error as a source of information. If every trial provides you with information about what does not work, — location: [1452](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009K6DKTS&location=1452) ^ref-8327

---
loser is someone who, after making a mistake, doesn’t introspect, doesn’t exploit it, feels embarrassed and defensive rather than enriched with a new piece of information, and tries to explain why he made the mistake rather than moving on. — location: [1495](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009K6DKTS&location=1495) ^ref-19221

---
avoidance of small mistakes makes the large ones more severe. — location: [1659](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009K6DKTS&location=1659) ^ref-51628
