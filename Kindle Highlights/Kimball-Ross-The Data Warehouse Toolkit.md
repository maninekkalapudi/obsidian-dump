## Highlights
operational record keeping and analytical decision making. — location: [929](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=929) ^ref-45854

---
operational systems are where you put the data in, and the DW/BI system is where you get the data out. — location: [930](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=930) ^ref-12549

---
operational systems are optimized to process transactions quickly. — location: [932](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=932) ^ref-47335

---
always deal with one transaction record at a time. — location: [933](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=933) ^ref-20591

---
operational systems typically do not maintain history, but rather update data to reflect the most current state. — location: [934](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=934) ^ref-53882

---
other hand, watch the wheels of the organization turn to evaluate performance. — location: [935](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=935) ^ref-64052

---
worry about whether operational processes are working correctly. — location: [937](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=937) ^ref-26113

---
DW/BI users almost never deal with one transaction at a time. — location: [938](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=938) ^ref-61018

---
These systems are optimized for high-performance queries as users’ questions often require that hundreds or hundreds of thousands of transactions be searched and compressed into an answer set. — location: [938](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=938) ^ref-47738

---
users of a DW/BI system typically demand that historical context be preserved to accurately evaluate the organization’s performance over time. — location: [940](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=940) ^ref-56722

---
“We collect tons of data, but we can’t access it.” “We need to slice and dice the data every which way.” “Business people need to get at the data easily.” “Just show me what is important.” “We spend entire meetings arguing about who has the right numbers rather than making decisions.” “We want people to use information to support more fact-based decision making.” — location: [954](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=954) ^ref-13377

---
The DW/BI system must make information easily accessible. — location: [961](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=961) ^ref-25984

---
The data must be intuitive and obvious to the business user, not merely the developer. — location: [962](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=962) ^ref-39668

---
Business users want to separate and combine analytic data in endless combinations. — location: [963](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=963) ^ref-5127

---
The DW/BI system must present information consistently. — location: [966](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=966) ^ref-33117

---
The DW/BI system must adapt to change. — location: [970](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=970) ^ref-35026

---
User needs, business conditions, data, and technology are all subject to change. The DW/BI system must be designed to handle this inevitable change gracefully so that it doesn’t invalidate existing data or applications. — location: [971](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=971) ^ref-20139

---
Finally, if descriptive data in the DW/BI system must be modified, you must appropriately account for the changes and make these changes transparent to the users. — location: [973](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=973) ^ref-7178

---
The DW/BI system must present information in a timely way. — location: [975](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=975) ^ref-42667

---
As the DW/BI system is used more intensively for operational decisions, raw data may need to be converted into actionable information within hours, minutes, or even seconds. The DW/BI team and business users need to have realistic expectations for what it means to deliver data when there is little time to clean or validate it. — location: [975](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=975) ^ref-51432

---
The DW/BI system must be a secure bastion that protects the information assets. — location: [978](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=978) ^ref-38029

---
An organization’s informational crown jewels are stored in the data warehouse. — location: [978](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=978) ^ref-46419

---
The DW/BI system must effectively control access to the organization’s confidential information. — location: [980](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=980) ^ref-30078

---
The DW/BI system must serve as the authoritative and trustworthy foundation for improved decision making. — location: [981](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=981) ^ref-18984

---
The data warehouse must have the right data to support decision making. The most important outputs from a DW/BI system are the decisions that are made based on the analytic evidence presented; these decisions deliver the business impact and value attributable to the DW/BI system. — location: [982](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=982) ^ref-5383

---
The business community must accept the DW/BI system to deem it successful. — location: [985](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=985) ^ref-53962

---
Unlike an operational system implementation where business users have no choice but to use the new system, DW/BI usage is sometimes optional. — location: [987](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=987) ^ref-30465

---
With a DW/BI initiative, you have one foot in your information technology (IT) comfort zone while your other foot is on the unfamiliar turf of business — location: [991](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=991) ^ref-40952

---
users. — location: [992](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=992) ^ref-1122

---
Understand the business users: — location: [1023](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1023) ^ref-51132

---
Deliver high-quality, relevant, and accessible information and analytics to the business users: — location: [1027](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1027) ^ref-16347

---
Sustain the DW/BI environment: — location: [1033](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1033) ^ref-22647

---
Deliver data that’s understandable to the business users. Deliver fast query performance. — location: [1046](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1046) ^ref-23922

---
Simplicity is critical because it ensures that users can easily understand the data, as well as allows software to navigate and deliver results quickly and efficiently. — location: [1049](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1049) ^ref-3602

---
The ability to visualize something as abstract as a set of data in a concrete and tangible way is the secret of understandability. — location: [1055](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1055) ^ref-33252

---
Although dimensional models are often instantiated in relational database management systems, they are quite different from third normal form (3NF) models which seek to remove data redundancies. — location: [1059](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1059) ^ref-53137

---
Normalized 3NF structures divide data into many discrete entities, each of which becomes a relational table. — location: [1060](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1060) ^ref-63011

---
Entity-relationship diagrams (ER diagrams or ERDs) are drawings that communicate the relationships between tables. — location: [1064](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1064) ^ref-28708

---
the key difference between 3NF and dimensional models is the degree of normalization. — location: [1066](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1066) ^ref-61314

---
Normalized 3NF structures are immensely useful in operational processing because an update or insert transaction touches the database in only one place. — location: [1068](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1068) ^ref-25743

---
Normalized models, however, are too complicated for BI queries. — location: [1069](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1069) ^ref-63605

---
most relational database management systems can’t efficiently query a normalized model; the complexity of users’ unpredictable queries overwhelms the — location: [1070](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1070) ^ref-40861

---
database optimizers, resulting in disastrous query performance. — location: [1071](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1071) ^ref-38026

---
Star Schemas Versus OLAP Cubes — location: [1078](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1078) ^ref-64911

---
Dimensional models implemented in relational database management systems are referred to as star schemas — location: [1079](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1079) ^ref-17594

---
a star-like structure. — location: [1080](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1080) ^ref-51540

---
Dimensional models implemented in multidimensional database environments are referred to as online analytical processing (OLAP) cubes, — location: [1080](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1080) ^ref-51725

---
When data is loaded into an OLAP cube, it is stored and indexed using formats and techniques that are designed for dimensional data. — location: [1087](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1087) ^ref-8251

---
Performance aggregations or precalculated summary tables are often created and managed by the OLAP cube engine. — location: [1088](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1088) ^ref-59024

---
Consequently, cubes deliver superior query performance because of the precalculations, indexing strategies, and other optimizations. — location: [1089](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1089) ^ref-10435

---
Business users can drill down or up by — location: [1090](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1090) ^ref-56366

---
adding or removing attributes from their analyses with excellent performance without issuing new queries. — location: [1091](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1091) ^ref-34956

---
Fact Tables for Measurements — location: [1119](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1119) ^ref-53731

---
The fact table in a dimensional model stores the performance measurements resulting from an organization’s business process events. — location: [1119](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1119) ^ref-32179

---
fact table in a dimensional model stores the performance measurements resulting from an organization’s business process events. — location: [1119](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1119) ^ref-62289

---
fact represents a business measure. — location: [1124](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1124) ^ref-11619

---
Each row in a fact table corresponds to a measurement event. — location: [1131](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1131) ^ref-48649

---
The data on each row is at a specific level of detail, referred to as the grain, — location: [1131](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1131) ^ref-51493

---
The most useful facts are numeric and additive, — location: [1139](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1139) ^ref-3694

---
Semi-additive facts, such as account balances, cannot be summed across the time dimension. Non-additive facts, such as unit prices, can never be added. — location: [1144](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1144) ^ref-9638

---
all fact table grains fall into one of three categories: transaction, periodic snapshot, and accumulating snapshot. — location: [1161](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1161) ^ref-12000

---
All fact tables have two or more foreign keys (refer to the FK notation in Figure 1-2) that connect to the dimension tables’ primary keys. — location: [1165](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1165) ^ref-52565

---
The fact table generally has its own primary key composed of a subset of the foreign keys. This key is often called a composite key. Every table that has a composite key is a fact table. Fact tables express many-to-many relationships. All others are dimension tables. — location: [1169](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1169) ^ref-62865

---
Dimension Tables for Descriptive Context — location: [1175](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1175) ^ref-56510

---
Dimension tables are integral companions to a fact table. — location: [1176](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1176) ^ref-64051

---
dimension tables contain the textual context associated with a business process measurement event. They describe the “who, what, where, when, how, and why” associated with the event. — location: [1177](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1177) ^ref-45000

---
contain the textual context associated with a business process measurement event. — location: [1177](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1177) ^ref-52022

They describe the “who, what, where, when, how, and why” associated with the event. — location: [1177](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1177) ^ref-29162

---
Dimension tables tend to have fewer rows than fact tables, but can be wide with many large text columns. — location: [1180](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1180) ^ref-18186

---
Each dimension is defined by a single primary key (refer to the PK notation — location: [1181](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1181) ^ref-40303

---
primary key — location: [1181](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1181) ^ref-11377

---
which serves as the basis for referential integrity with any given fact table to which it is joined. — location: [1182](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1182) ^ref-50406

---
Dimension attributes serve as the primary source of query constraints, groupings, and report labels. — location: [1186](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1186) ^ref-39179

---
they are the source of virtually all constraints and report labels, dimension attributes are critical to making the DW/BI system usable and understandable. — location: [1190](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1190) ^ref-44588

---
Attributes should consist of real words rather than cryptic abbreviations. — location: [1191](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1191) ^ref-7555

---
decode values should never be buried in the reporting applications where inconsistency is inevitable. — location: [1195](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1195) ^ref-34933

---
data warehouse is only as good as the dimension attributes; — location: [1201](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1201) ^ref-47643

---
analytic power of the DW/BI environment is directly proportional to the quality and depth of the dimension attributes. — location: [1202](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1202) ^ref-45465

---
asking whether the column is a measurement that takes on lots of values and participates in calculations (making it a fact) or is a discretely valued description that is more or less constant and participates in constraints and row labels (making it a dimensional attribute). — location: [1210](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1210) ^ref-57010

---
the standard cost for a product seems like a constant attribute of the product but may be changed so often that you decide it is more like a measured fact. — location: [1212](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1212) ^ref-2405

---
dimension tables often represent hierarchical relationships. — location: [1220](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1220) ^ref-56958

---
For example, products roll up into brands and then into categories. — location: [1220](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1220) ^ref-8429

---
The hierarchical — location: [1222](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1222) ^ref-33862

---
descriptive information is stored redundantly in the spirit of ease of use and query performance. You should resist the perhaps habitual urge to normalize data by storing only the brand code in the product dimension and creating a separate brand lookup table, and likewise for the category description in a separate category lookup table. — location: [1222](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1222) ^ref-60472

---
Facts and Dimensions Joined in a Star Schema — location: [1237](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1237) ^ref-61513

---
Each business process is represented by a dimensional model that consists of a fact table containing the event’s numeric measurements surrounded by a halo of dimension tables that contain the textual context that was true at the moment the event occurred. — location: [1240](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1240) ^ref-50233

---
star join, — location: [1242](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1242) ^ref-40633

---
The predictable framework of a dimensional model withstands unexpected changes in user behavior. Every dimension is equivalent; all dimensions are symmetrically-equal entry points into the fact table. — location: [1256](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1256) ^ref-24256

---
four separate and distinct components to consider in the DW/BI environment: operational source systems, ETL system, data presentation area, and business intelligence applications. — location: [1294](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1294) ^ref-42192

---
operational systems of record that capture the business’s transactions. — location: [1300](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1300) ^ref-10286

---
main priorities of the source systems are processing performance and availability. — location: [1302](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1302) ^ref-45168

---
Operational queries against source systems are narrow, — location: [1303](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1303) ^ref-17405

---
one-record-at-a-time queries that are part of the normal transaction flow and severely restricted in their demands on the operational system. — location: [1303](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1303) ^ref-50882

---
source systems are not queried in the broad and unexpected ways that DW/BI systems typically are queried. — location: [1304](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1304) ^ref-16482

---
Source systems maintain little historical data; — location: [1305](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1305) ^ref-6977

---
Extract, Transformation, and Load System — location: [1310](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1310) ^ref-34385

---
getting data into the data warehouse environment. — location: [1316](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1316) ^ref-17065

---
After the data is extracted to the ETL system, there are numerous potential transformations, such as cleansing the data (correcting misspellings, resolving domain conflicts, dealing with missing elements, or parsing into standard formats), combining data from multiple sources, and de-duplicating data. — location: [1318](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1318) ^ref-21450

---
final step of the ETL process is the physical structuring and loading of data into the presentation area’s target dimensional models. — location: [1323](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1323) ^ref-37249

---
Presentation Area to Support Business Intelligence — location: [1351](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1351) ^ref-21959

---
DW/BI presentation area is where data is organized, stored, and made available for direct querying by users, report writers, and other analytical BI applications. — location: [1352](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1352) ^ref-44519

---
presentation area is the DW/BI environment as far as the business community is concerned; it is all the business sees and touches via their access tools and BI applications. — location: [1354](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1354) ^ref-48646

---
data be presented, stored, and accessed in dimensional schemas, either relational star schemas or OLAP cubes. — location: [1358](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1358) ^ref-32283

---
the presentation area is that it must contain detailed, atomic data. — location: [1361](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1361) ^ref-3867

---
The most finely grained data must be available in the presentation area so that users can ask the most precise questions possible. Because users’ requirements are unpredictable and constantly changing, you must provide access to the exquisite details so they can roll up to address the questions of the moment. — location: [1368](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1368) ^ref-5522

---
presentation data area should be structured around business process measurement events. — location: [1371](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1371) ^ref-7096

---
This approach naturally aligns with the operational source data capture systems. — location: [1371](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1371) ^ref-12990

---
Dimensional models should correspond to physical data capture events; they should not be designed to deliver the report-of-the-day. An enterprise’s business processes cross the boundaries of organizational departments and functions. In other words, you should construct a single fact table for atomic sales metrics rather than populating separate similar, but slightly different, databases containing sales metrics for the sales, marketing, logistics, and finance teams. — location: [1372](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1372) ^ref-51785

---
All the dimensional structures must be built using common, conformed dimensions. — location: [1376](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1376) ^ref-61822

---
Isolated stovepipe data sets that cannot be tied together are the bane of the DW/BI movement as they perpetuate incompatible views of the enterprise. — location: [1379](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1379) ^ref-10883

---
If you have any hope of building a robust and integrated DW/BI environment, you must commit to the enterprise bus architecture. — location: [1380](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1380) ^ref-51509

---
Data in the queryable presentation area of the DW/BI system must be dimensional, atomic (complemented by performance-enhancing aggregates), business process-centric, and adhere to the enterprise data warehouse bus architecture. The data must not be structured according to individual departments’ interpretation of the data. — location: [1387](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1387) ^ref-13044

---
Business Intelligence Applications — location: [1391](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1391) ^ref-16563

---
A BI application can be as simple as an ad hoc query tool or as complex as a sophisticated data mining or modeling application. — location: [1395](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1395) ^ref-4639

---
Ad hoc query tools, as powerful — location: [1396](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1396) ^ref-14981

---
as they are, can be understood and used effectively by only a small percentage of the potential DW/BI business user population. — location: [1397](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DRZX6XS&location=1397) ^ref-45806

---
