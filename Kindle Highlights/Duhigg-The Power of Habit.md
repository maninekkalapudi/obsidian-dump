## Highlights
Habits, scientists say, emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort. — location: [419](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006WAIV6M&location=419) ^ref-48469

This process within our brains is a three-step loop. First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future: — location: [435](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006WAIV6M&location=435) ^ref-64886

---
When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making. It stops working so hard, or diverts focus to other tasks. So unless you deliberately fight a habit—unless you find new routines—the pattern will unfold automatically. — location: [445](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006WAIV6M&location=445) ^ref-13550

Habits never really disappear. They’re encoded into the structures of our brain, and that’s a huge advantage for us, because it would be awful if we had to relearn how to drive after every vacation. The problem is that your brain can’t tell the difference between bad and good habits, and so if you have a bad one, it’s always lurking there, waiting for the right cues and rewards.”20 — location: [451](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006WAIV6M&location=451) ^ref-19930

So what, exactly, did Hopkins do? He created a craving. And that craving, it turns out, is what makes cues and rewards work. That craving is what powers the habit loop. — location: [652](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006WAIV6M&location=652) ^ref-54849

First, find a simple and obvious cue. Second, clearly define the rewards. — location: [693](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006WAIV6M&location=693) ^ref-26469

---
This is how new habits are created: by putting together a cue, a routine, and a reward, and then cultivating a craving that drives the loop. — location: [898](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006WAIV6M&location=898) ^ref-11627

---
Cravings are what drive habits. And figuring out how to spark a craving makes creating a new habit easier. — location: [1055](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006WAIV6M&location=1055) ^ref-40109

Belief was the ingredient that made a reworked habit loop into a permanent behavior. — location: [1440](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006WAIV6M&location=1440) ^ref-65292

The evidence is clear: If you want to change a habit, you must find an alternative routine, and your odds of success go up dramatically when you commit to changing as part of a group. Belief is essential, and it grows out of a communal experience, even if that community is only as large as two people. — location: [1569](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006WAIV6M&location=1569) ^ref-62563

Individuals have habits; groups have routines,” — location: [1703](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006WAIV6M&location=1703) ^ref-57489

“Routines are the organizational analogue of habits.” — location: [1704](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006WAIV6M&location=1704) ^ref-52594

Willpower isn’t just a skill. It’s a muscle, like the muscles in your arms or legs, and it gets tired as it works harder, so there’s less power left over for other things.” — location: [2229](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006WAIV6M&location=2229) ^ref-9700

---
This is how willpower becomes a habit: by choosing a certain behavior ahead of time, and then following that routine when an inflection point arrives. — location: [2378](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006WAIV6M&location=2378) ^ref-5208
